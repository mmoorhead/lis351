			I use my success in academics, debate, and competitive speech to communicate effectively with my peers and learn more with every effort. Whether it be working with fellow entrepreneurs to increase the efficiency of our businesses, or working with other students on a class project, I utilize my results-oriented mindset to find innovation solutions to complex problems.
